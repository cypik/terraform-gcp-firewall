## Introduction

This Terraform configuration sets up GCP infrastructure, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and firewall rules with specified configurations.

## Usage

To get started, make sure you have configured your GCP provider. You can use the following code as a starting point:

```hcl

module "firewall" {
  source        = "git::https://github.com/opz0/terraform-gcp-firewall.git?ref=v1.0.0"
  name          = "app"
  environment   = "test"
  network       = module.vpc.vpc_id
  priority      = 1000
  source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

  allow = [
    {
      protocol = "tcp"
      ports    = ["22", "80"]
    }
  ]
}
```
Make sure to configure the provider block with your GCP credentials or use other authentication methods. Adjust the variables according to your requirements.

## Module Inputs
